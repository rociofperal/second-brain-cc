"""Which vault notes a session gets credit for, with no hook input and no database.

vault_ledger.py (the Claude Code PostToolUse adapter) and the file-watch job both decide
credit with these rules. The window rule is unchanged from vault_ledger.py: a note counts
when its mtime is later than the session's previous look, capped at MAX_WINDOW seconds —
it fails on the safe side (asking for /save again), never towards crediting someone who
did not save — and notes a git pull rewrote are never anyone's.
