"""Where Brain keeps its own machine-local state. Resolved here and nowhere else.

  BRAIN_STATE                          when set (a leading ~ is expanded)
  ~/Library/Application Support/brain  on macOS
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\brain                 on Windows
  $XDG_STATE_HOME/brain                elsewhere, or ~/.local/state/brain

Deliberately not under ~/.claude. State, logs, queues and ledgers belong to Brain, and
must survive an agent being uninstalled, reset, logged into another account or
replaced by a different one. Everything that needs the directory asks this module, so
moving it is one environment variable, not a hunt through every script.

Before the move, ~/.claude/state/brain is still where every existing script keeps its state:
`effective_state_dir()` returns that until migrate_state.py has moved it and left a symlink.

Usage:  brain_paths.py      prints the Brain state directory and the one in use today
