"""PostToolUse — records which vault notes THIS session wrote.

It replaces the `wrote` counter, which only `vw.py` and the `librarian` subagent
incremented: a note written straight into `30-Knowledge/` —which is exactly what
protocol §5 mandates— did not count as having saved.

The command is not parsed and the tool is not taken at its word: the disk is checked.
After each tool call, notes with an mtime inside the window are looked up
(this session's last post, now], and credited to the `sid` arriving in the
hook — never deduced from cwd (see 2026-08-21-failure-wrote-credited-to-the-wrong-session).

The window is capped at MAX_WINDOW seconds. If a call takes longer, the write is lost
and the gate will ask for /save again: it fails on the safe side (asking too much), never
towards crediting someone who did not save.
