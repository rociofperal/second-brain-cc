"""T1 — UserPromptSubmit hook. Injects vault pointers, on a budget.

Principles:
  - A pointer, not context: title + path. The agent reads it if it cares.
  - What gets injected stays in the transcript FOREVER -> per-session budget.
  - A note is injected once per session (dedupe).
  - On any error: silence and exit 0.
