"""The conflict check before any calendar write google.py makes. Pure: every read goes through `call`.

The rule: whenever an event is added or moved, look at what is already in the calendar first. If
something is there, stop and propose alternatives instead of booking on top of it. It exists
because an interview was once moved onto a slot that already held another meeting, and nobody
noticed until afterwards.

How google.py uses it: `api` with POST, PATCH or PUT on a Calendar events URL goes through
`guard()` before the request leaves. When the new slot overlaps anything, nothing is written, the
conflicts and a handful of free alternatives are printed as JSON and google.py exits 3. Once the
user has picked a slot, or explicitly accepted the overlap, rerun with `--force`. `google.py slots`
runs the same check for a slot without writing anything.

What counts as a conflict:
  - the calendar being written: any event in the window that blocks time (not "free"/transparent,
    not cancelled, not declined by this account, not a working-location or focus marker left
    free), other than the event being moved;
  - other attendees: their free/busy, when Google shares it (the same organization usually does,
    outside addresses usually do not; those come back as "unknown", never as free). For a move,
    the attendee's copy of this very event, the old slot, is cut out.

Alternatives: slots of the same length where everyone visible is free, inside working hours
(09:00 to 19:00 in the event's time zone, Monday to Friday; `slots --hours` narrows it), at most
two per day, from the requested day on. They ignore other people's time zones: before offering
them, drop the ones that fall at night for someone.

`call(url, method="GET", body=None)` returns Google's JSON, or {"_http_error": status, ...} the way
google.py's `api` does. A read that fails raises GuardError: a check that could not look is not a
check that found the slot free.
