"""The Brain guardian's rules, with no IO at all.

Everything the guardian decides lives here: how Brain's hooks merge into a settings file
that other tools also write, when a problem is worth telling the user about and when it
is the same problem as fifteen minutes ago, when a routine is due, and what counts as a
problem in the first place. The inputs are plain values and "now" is always passed in,
so every rule can be tested with literals.

What is deliberately NOT imported here: os, subprocess, pathlib, time, json or any
clock. Reading the world is the adapters' job (guardian_core/adapters.py).
