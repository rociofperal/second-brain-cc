"""Runs the vault's periodic tasks, filtered by the machine it is running on.

The registry lives in the vault (90-Meta/scheduled-tasks.md) so every machine sees
the same list, but each task declares WHICH machine owns it. A task whose `machine`
column does not match this host is never executed here — the harness runs on several
machines and a task pinned to one must not fire on the others.

Invoked every 10 minutes by the scheduler accepted at first run (launchd com.secondbrain.tasks, a
systemd user timer or a cron line second-brain-tasks). A task fires when:
  - its `machine` is `*`, this host's name, or any form machine_identity.machine_is_mine()
    accepts for this machine (its key, its uuid, a historical key),
  - today matches its `days`,
  - its scheduled time has passed today,
  - and it has not already run today.

That last condition is what makes a 10-minute poll safe: a task scheduled at 06:00 runs
once, not six times an hour. It also means a machine that was asleep at 06:00 still runs
the task when it wakes — late is better than skipped. Use `catchup=no` to opt out.

A `time` of `every Nh` (`every 1h`, `every 6h`) instead of `HH:MM` repeats through the day:
the daily mark is ignored and the gap since the last run decides, so the same 10-minute poll
gives it its cadence. An interval missed while the machine slept is not caught up; the next
poll runs it and the clock restarts.

An agent routine whose front matter says `single_instance: true` never runs twice at once:
each run holds an exclusive lock on <state>/task-locks/<id>.lock for as long as it lasts, so a
tick that finds it still running (an hourly routine that overruns its hour, or a `--force`
started by hand) skips it and leaves its state alone; the next tick after it ends decides
again. `--force` on a running one is refused with exit 75. Other tasks are not locked.

A routine is killed after DEFAULT_TIMEOUT (30 min) unless its front matter sets
`timeout_minutes: <n>`, for a routine whose job has no fixed size (a backlog to work
through). Pair it with `single_instance: true` so an overrun never overlaps the next tick.

Usage:
  tasks.py            run whatever is due on this machine
  tasks.py --list     show the registry as this machine sees it
  tasks.py --dry-run  say what would run, run nothing
  tasks.py --force <id>  run one task now, ignoring schedule and last-run, but NOT the
                         `machine` column: a task owned by another machine is refused
                         (exit 3), because forcing one that posts somewhere from the wrong
                         machine posts it twice. `--anywhere` overrides that, deliberately.

`--list` prints at the top what this host matches as: its hostname and its stable machine
key (machine_identity), either of which a row's `machine` may name.

Task types:
  shell       the runner executes `command` with the vault as working directory
  agent       `command` is a routine file (90-Meta/routines/<id>.md); its body is handed
              to the CLI agent named in 90-Meta/agent-command.txt (or BRAIN_AGENT_CMD),
              followed by the routine's own `agent_args`. First, routine_requires.py checks
              that this machine has the repos, programs and paths the routine needs (its
              agent_args and its `requires:` line); a gap refuses the run, exit 2, before any
              token is read. The run goes through
              routine_auth_core: a token from the pool in 90-Meta/routine-tokens.json, read
              from KeePass, is the only credential in an environment built from scratch;
              a refused or limited token fails over to the next. Each attempt gets a run id,
              a private scratch directory under <brain state>/routine-scratch (granted with
              --add-dir, deleted on success, kept 7 days on failure) and a prompt that wraps
              the body in an explicit order to run it now. A routine whose contract requires
              sends succeeds only if google.py send logged them under that run id.
              A failure raises an alert through the guardian's channel naming what to do; a
              success clears it.
