"""Cross-machine file claims, over a shared filesystem path — not S3.

A second machine sharing this vault (a Dropbox, iCloud or NAS folder configured through
brain_shared.py) can warn "someone is already editing this" for a file that exists in more
than one checkout of the same repo — a second machine, or a worktree with a different local
path. The resource a file maps to is repo-independent: `claims_core.resource_for()` turns a
path into `<host>/<org>/<repo>/<relative path>`, resolved here from `git remote get-url
origin` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (claims_core itself never shells out).

One small JSON record per (resource, machine, session) lives at
`<shared>/claims/<resource>/<machine>__<sid>.json`, guarded by B.flock the same way
lease.py and presence.py guard their own files. `machine_identity.current_key()` is used
instead of bare hostname, so two machines that happen to share one do not collide.

How it is wired in:

  - claim.py, after recording or releasing claims in its local SQLite table, calls
    `publish_async(sid)`: a detached `claims_sync.py publish --sid <sid>` that reads that
    session's claims from the table and hands them to `sync()` as the whole desired set. The
    claim command itself never waits on the shared path.
  - gate_write.py calls `remote_conflict(path)`, which reads only the local cache this module
    writes (an open(), no shared-path IO on the hook path) and names a fresh claim another
    machine holds on the same repo file. The git lookup that maps the file to its resource
    runs only when the cache holds some other machine's claim at all.

Claims gate_write records on its own for each edited file stay local: they are published only
when claim.py runs for that session. The CLI (`claim`, `release`, `reap`, `view`, `publish`)
is still there for a deliberate call.

`sync()` is deliberately safe to call with no known local claims: passing `paths=None` runs
a read-only refresh (rescans the shared path and rewrites the local cache) with no publish or
withdraw. Calling `claims_core.plan()` with an EMPTY local set would read as "release
everything of mine", which is exactly wrong for a periodic housekeeping pass that knows
nothing about what this session currently claims — `None` is not the same as "nothing", and
this module keeps that distinction. `reap()` and this refresh are what presence.py's existing
120 s `should_beat()` cadence calls (see presence.py); actually declaring or releasing a claim
for a specific file is a deliberate call with a real `paths` list, from this module's CLI.

Everything here fails open: with nothing configured, with the shared path unreachable, or
with the sync lock held elsewhere, nothing is written and nothing raises. See
claims_sync_test.py.
