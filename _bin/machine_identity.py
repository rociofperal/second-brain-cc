"""Machine identity: a key that tells apart two machines that share a hostname.

`brainlib._machine()` is the hostname alone, and stays that way: every existing caller
(`claim.py`, `lease.py`, `vault_sync.py`'s local logging) is unaffected by this module. But a
hostname is not unique — several machines can report the very same one — and that only matters
once two machines coordinate over a shared path (the presence beat, `claims_sync.py`'s record
filenames): a lease or a claim keyed on hostname alone would then silently apply to both.

`machine_key()` appends the first 8 hex characters of a hardware/boot UUID, read the way the OS
exposes it:

  macOS    `ioreg -rd1 -c IOPlatformExpertDevice -r`, "IOPlatformUUID"
  Linux    `/etc/machine-id` (no root needed), else `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid`
  Windows  `MachineGuid` under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography (`reg query`, no admin needed)

Only that 8-hex fragment is ever written to disk; the full UUID never is, and neither leaves the
machine it was read on.

The key carries the hostname, so it changes when the hostname does. That is fine for a file name
and wrong for "is this record mine?": `machine_is_mine()` answers that one, and accepts every form
this machine has written (the current key, the raw uuid, the bare label `brainlib._machine()` still
writes locally, a key from before a rename that ends in the same fragment, and any alias listed in
`BRAIN_MACHINE_ALIASES`). A machine that stops recognising its own name either locks itself out of
its own records or clears someone else's. Every effect (which platform this is, how to run a command, how to open a
file) is a parameter, the same style as `kp.py`'s `cache_backend()` / `dialog_backend()`, so the
decision is testable with no real hardware. See machine_identity_test.py.
