"""Routes kp.py's credential calls to whichever KeePass client this machine actually has.

kp.py speaks one protocol: keepassxc-cli's. That is still the default and, unmodified, the
only backend most users ever need. But keepassxc-cli cannot be installed on every machine, and
someone sharing a `.kdbx` over a synced path (never S3 — see brain_shared.py) between two
machines may have `kpcli` (the Perl KeePass client) on the one where KeePassXC will not go.
This module is the single place that knows the difference: `_resolve()` decides which backend
this machine speaks, `translate()` turns the small, fixed set of keepassxc-cli-shaped argv
kp.py's own `cli()` builds into what `kp_kdbx.pl` (the kpcli-backed helper, new to this repo)
expects, and `run()` carries out one call end to end.

**Scope, on purpose.** Only the subcommands `kp.py` actually issues through its central
`cli()` function are translated: `ls`, `search`, `show`, `mkdir`, `add`, `edit`, and the
reorganisation set `mv`, `rm`, `rmdir` (checked against every `cli([...])` call site in
kp.py). Everything else that reaches `cli()` raises `Unsupported`, which kp.py's `cli()` turns into a clear `die()`
naming the operation, never a silent no-op or a bare traceback. `clip`, `db-create` and the
`.lock`-file probing in `guard_lock`/`lock_state` never reach this module at all — they call
`CLI` directly in kp.py and get their own explicit `KIND == "kpcli"` guard there, for the same
reason: a full port of every direct call site in a 1700-line, carefully hardened file is
meaningfully riskier than translating the handful that matter (see the plan's open design
decision on this cut).

**Key files.** A store may be keyed by a master, a key file, or both. keepassxc-cli reads
`-k <path>` (and `--no-password` for a store whose key file is the whole key) from its own argv.
kp_kdbx.pl takes its arguments by name, so for the kpcli backend `build()` strips those flags and
passes the path in the helper's environment as BRAIN_KP_KEYFILE; kp_kdbx.pl then builds the
File::KDBX composite key, or uses the key file alone when there is no master.

**The kpcli bug this exists to fix.** kp.py's `cmd_put` always sends `given + "\\n" + given +
"\\n"` on stdin when writing a secret — keepassxc-cli's own protocol reads that as
password-then-confirmation correctly, but a Perl script that just slurps stdin would store
BOTH lines as one literal value, silently doubling every secret it writes. `split_confirmation`
is the fix, applied only on the kpcli path; keepassxc-cli's already-correct behavior is
untouched. See kp_backend_test.py.
