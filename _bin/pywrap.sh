#!/bin/sh
# Picks a python3 that actually runs, then execs it with every argument unchanged.
#
# launchd starts brain-sync, brain-tasks and brain-guardian through this instead of
# naming /usr/bin/python3 directly. /usr/bin/python3 is an xcrun shim: after an Xcode
# update whose license was not accepted it exits 69 without running anything, and every
# daemon pinned to it died in silence. Here it degrades to the next interpreter instead.
#
# Order (the first that answers `-c ""` with exit 0 wins):
#   each candidate with DEVELOPER_DIR=CommandLineTools (only when the caller did not set
#   DEVELOPER_DIR and that directory exists), then the same candidate as-is.
# Candidates: /usr/bin/python3, /opt/homebrew/bin/python3, /usr/local/bin/python3.
#
# Pure POSIX sh on purpose: it has to run before any Python is known to work.
# BRAIN_PY_CANDIDATES (colon-separated) and BRAIN_PY_CLT override the defaults; the
# tests use them, and so can a machine with its interpreter somewhere else.
