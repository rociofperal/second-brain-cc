"""remote_control.py: the Remote Control server this machine keeps running, so the Claude app can reach it.

  remote_control.py serve   start `claude remote-control --chrome --name <name>` from the recorded
                            working directory; what the launchd agent and the systemd user unit run
  remote_control.py show    print the recorded directory, name and command, and anything in the way

Every machine Brain is installed on is a Remote Control machine: it appears in the Claude app under
Remote Control and a session opened there runs on this machine, with its files, credentials and
browser. The server is a long-lived process, supervised (launchd KeepAlive on macOS, systemd
Restart=always on Linux), because it gives up and exits after about ten minutes without network.

The supervisor templates (`com.secondbrain.remote-control.plist`, `systemd/second-brain-remote-control.service`)
carry nothing per machine, so the guardian can keep them in step like every other job. What is per
machine lives in <brain state>/remote-control.json, written by the first run's remote_control step:

  dir    the working directory sessions open in: the home directory by default, so a session started
         from the app opens where you would open a terminal. A dedicated folder or repository works too.
         No git repository is needed, because spawn mode stays same-dir (see --spawn below). Workspace
         trust is kept per directory, the home directory included (projects[<dir>].hasTrustDialogAccepted
         in ~/.claude.json), and is accepted once, interactively.
  name   passed as --name; it titles the sessions. The label the app groups them under is the server's
         environment, which the server is assigned and which is renamed from the app.

Three things are not arbitrary:
  --chrome is always passed. The claudeInChromeDefaultEnabled setting does not cover server mode, and
           without the flag every session has no browser tools.
  --spawn  is never passed. A worktree spawn mode conflicts with Brain's WorktreeCreate hook
           (seed_worktree.py) and every session dies at birth, hanging on "Connecting...". It is also
           the only mode that would need the working directory to be a git repository.
  env      DISABLE_TELEMETRY, DO_NOT_TRACK, CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC and DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK
           switch off the feature flags Remote Control depends on, and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or
           CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN would replace the claude.ai login it needs; serve drops all of them.
