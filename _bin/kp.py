"""kp — credentials for the Brain system. The only path to read and write passwords.

The vault NEVER stores credentials: it stores `kp://Group/Entry#password` references
that resolve against a local KeePass database (.kdbx) chosen by its owner at first run
(`kp.py init --db PATH`, or BRAIN_KP_DB). macOS, Linux and Windows.

  kp.py status                      state of the kdbx, the lock and the cache
  kp.py init --db PATH [--keyfile PATH] [--create [--no-password]]
                                    record (or create) the database this machine uses
  kp.py unlock [--ttl 365d]         arm the master cache for 365 days (to work remotely later)
  kp.py lock                        forget the cached master
  kp.py ls [group] [-R]             list entries (never secrets)
  kp.py search <text>
  kp.py get <entry> [-a attr] [--copy|--show|--pipe CMD]
  kp.py put <entry> [-u user] [--url U] [--notes N] [--generate|--ask] [-L n]
  kp.py set <entry> [...]           edit an existing entry
  kp.py ref <entry>                 print the kp:// reference to paste into a note

Invariants (do not break them when editing):
  1. The master never passes through argv, nor the environment, nor plaintext on disk.
     It goes from the prompt (or the OS keyring cache) into keepassxc-cli's stdin and dies there.
  2. A secret is never printed unless the user explicitly asks with `--show`. By default
     it goes to the clipboard or into another process's stdin: that way it never enters
     the transcript.
  3. Every write takes a backup first and verifies the database afterwards. If the
     database does not open after writing, the backup is restored automatically.

# `cp` and `python3` read the very same file with no trouble, a path that does not
# exist gives "not found" (so the volume answers), and a local copy —even `cp -p`,
# xattrs and all— opens normally. Most likely it maps the file into memory and smbfs
# does not give it what it expects. Unmounting and remounting does not fix it.
#
# The symptom is cruel: the dialog appears, the master is right, and it dies with
# `cannot open the database:` AND AN EMPTY MESSAGE. Whoever is typing concludes their
# password is wrong. That is why this is not worked around from outside any more.
#
# So when the direct open fails for a reason that is NOT the password, the .kdbx is
# copied to a private local directory and `keepassxc-cli` is pointed at the copy.

# backup taken and its `verify_or_restore` waiting behind it.
#
# What does NOT move to the copy: the lock, the backups, the mount checks, and above
# all the Keychain cache key, which is the hash of the database path. Hashing a
