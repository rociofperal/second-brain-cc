"""Smoke test for integrations/claude-code/install.sh in a scratch HOME.

install.sh runs for real, with HOME and BRAIN_STATE pointed at a temporary directory and stdin
that is not a terminal: skills and agents land in the scratch ~/.claude with the vault path filled
in, the hooks are merged into its settings.json, recommended settings are shown but not merged, and
no scheduled job is installed. Run standalone:
