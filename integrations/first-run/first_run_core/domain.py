"""The first run's rules. Pure: no IO, no clock, no platform calls.

The first run asks, one step at a time, whether to connect each optional piece, and where to keep
files (the one step that cannot be declined). Every answer is kept in <brain state>/first-run.json,
so running it again resumes where it stopped and never asks an answered question twice:

  steps       {step: {"status": "done" | "declined", "at": ISO time, ...details}}
  scheduler   {"kind": "launchd" | "systemd" | "cron" | "none", "jobs": [accepted job names]}

The remote_control step's own entry ({"kind", "dir", "name"}) is what tells the guardian to keep the
Remote Control server installed too; it is not one of the scheduler's periodic jobs.

A step that failed, or that waits on a step not done yet, is not recorded: the next run asks it
again. Declining a step also declines the steps that cannot work without it. The guardian reads
`scheduler` and installs or reloads only those jobs.
